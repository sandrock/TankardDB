# TankardDB

Experimenting a simple document store for client app scenarios

## Status

POC. See [TODO](TODO.md).

## Goals

Provide a super-simple way to store and retreive C# objects.

Store in momory or on disk. Or someplace else.

## Why?

sqlite:

- forces you to manage a schema, this is boring
- has good performance
- is easy to backup

homemade serialized list

- has real bad performance when the list grows big
